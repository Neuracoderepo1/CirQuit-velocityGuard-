# VelocityGuard

VelocityGuard is a cost-and-risk gateway for metered API/provider spend
(e.g. LLM API calls). It sits in front of upstream providers and enforces a
deterministic control-plane pipeline on every request:

```
estimate -> reserve -> risk check -> allow / throttle / block -> execute -> reconcile -> telemetry
```

## Why

Metered API spend (LLM tokens, per-call billing, etc.) can spike fast enough
that after-the-fact billing alerts are too slow to prevent damage.
VelocityGuard reserves estimated cost *before* a call executes, scores
velocity/acceleration of spend in real time, and can throttle or block a
tenant/route/provider before an incident becomes expensive — then
reconciles the reservation against actual usage once the call completes.

## Core components

- **`internal/risk`** — deterministic (non-ML) risk engine: velocity and
  acceleration tracking, scoring, and ALLOW / ALLOW_WITH_LIMIT / THROTTLE /
  BLOCK decisions. No external dependency on the decision hot path.
- **`internal/circuit`** — CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED circuit
  breaker that cuts traffic to a tenant/provider/route after a violation
  and cautiously probes recovery.
- **`internal/reservation`** — pre-execution cost reservation and
  post-execution reconciliation against actual usage.
- **`internal/ledger`** — spend accounting.
- **`internal/pricing`** — provider/model pricing registry.
- **`internal/provider`** — upstream provider abstraction.
- **`internal/store`** — persistence, with in-memory and Postgres
  (`internal/store/postgres.go`) backends.
- **`internal/gateway`** — orchestrates the full request pipeline.
- **`internal/httpapi`** — HTTP surface.
- **`internal/config`** — configuration.
- **`internal/money`** — fixed-point money handling (micros).
- **`migrations/`** — SQL migrations for the control-plane schema.
- **`cmd/gateway`** — MVP entrypoint: runs the full pipeline over real HTTP
  with an in-memory demo tenant and a mock provider, so it starts with zero
  external dependencies (no Postgres/Redis required).
- **`tests/integration`** — end-to-end acceptance tests.

## Getting started

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/gateway
```

## Status

Early-stage MVP: core pipeline, risk engine, circuit breaker, and
reservation/reconciliation flow are implemented and covered by unit and
integration tests. Postgres store, HTTP API surface, and pricing/provider
registries exist but should be treated as scaffolding pending production
hardening (auth, observability, real provider adapters).
